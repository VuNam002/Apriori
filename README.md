The Apriori algorithm is a market basket analysis tool that helps retailers understand customer shopping behavior by identifying groups of products that are frequently purchased together. Based on the principle that if an itemset is frequent, all of its subsets must also be frequent, the algorithm reduces the number of item combinations to examine, thereby improving analysis efficiency.
